EDAAnimatedBackgroundImage
==========================

####An infinite animated background image like linked iOS application.

 - Inspired by [sachinkesiraju/SKPanoramaView](https://github.com/sachinkesiraju/SKPanoramaView) 

 - written in Swift 1.2

###Main Features (since v0.1):

  - for now, this project is only `demo purpose`
      + how to animate background image in `swift 1.2`
      + how to manage animation (stop, resume) when application goes background
      + on simulator go Home ; press `SHIFT+COMMAND+H`, then enter back app
          * animation starts again and don't freeze
  
###Added since v0.2 :
  - added a `cool alternative not to brutal reset position` after app `resume from background. No more instant reset.
      + Since v0.2, `fast but smooth return animation` so that background animated image returns initial point and `then main animation restart`
      + `target output` more verbose to follow image background animation.
